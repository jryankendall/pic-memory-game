## About
- Homework assignment for Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, due June 5, 2019. It is a simple web-based memory game using React and specifically states where the user clicks on the randomly-appended images; if they click an image they have not clicked previously in their streak, their streak score is incremented by 1, and the images shuffled. If they click one they already clicked in the current streak, the streak score is reset to 0. The user's highest streak is recorded and listed as well.
